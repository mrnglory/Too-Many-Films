# Too-Many-Films
> There are too many films, and too many OTT services these days.
This makes difficult to find where the contents users want right away. 
This is the problem our project is trying to solve. 
By simply entering the content's name whoever want to see into the search field on our site, 
they can easily find out which OTT is serving such contents. 
It started as a graduation project and is currently ongoing as of April 27th.
